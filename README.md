### About dataset

The IRIUST dataset is different from the international datasets and has been prepared according to the culture and environment of Iran. Also, it has been tried to record raw dataset movies from places and conditions that maintain a range of challenges (quality of movies, amount of light, diversity, etc. ) in the dataset.
Therefore, this data set can be a good representative of the real world data set.
These videos were recorded by cameras with different resolution quality in places such as Iran University of Science and Technology, Al-Aima Mosque, Arbaeen procession, local fruit shop and supermarket in Tehran, the details of which are given separately in the table below.
